The user types "https://www.google.com" in their browser and presses Enter.
The browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution process to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.
Once the IP address is resolved, the browser establishes a secure connection (https) to the server IP on the appropriate port (typically port 443 for HTTPS).
The traffic between the browser and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
The traffic may pass through a firewall, which is a network security device that filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
The request may be distributed via a load balancer, which evenly distributes incoming requests across multiple web servers to ensure efficient resource utilization and high availability.
The web server receives the request and processes it, serving the appropriate web page to the browser.
The web page may contain dynamic content that requires processing by an application server.
The application server generates the web page by executing server-side code, accessing databases, and performing any necessary computations.
The application server sends requests to the database to retrieve the required data.
The database processes the requests and returns the requested data to the application server.
The application server integrates the retrieved data into the web page and generates the final response.
The web server sends the complete response back to the browser, which renders and displays the web page to the user.
This sequential flow represents a simplified overview of the request process when accessing a website like "https://www.google.com." Each step involves various protocols, technologies, and systems working together to deliver the requested web page to the user.
